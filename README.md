# Preference-Learning-with-Response-Time

This repository bundles two complementary experiment suites for studying preference learning augmented with response-time signals:

- `synthetic_nn/` recreates fully controlled synthetic benchmarks. Use its README for dataset generation, benchmarking scripts, and plotting commands.
- `image_experiments/` contains the PickScore-based image experiments, including data preparation, embedding extraction, training pipelines, and scaling analyses.

Each directory ships with its own `README.md` covering environment setup and step-by-step workflows. Start in the subproject most relevant to your data source, or run both to compare synthetic and real-image settings side by side.
