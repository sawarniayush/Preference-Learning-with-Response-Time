# Preference-Learning-with-Response-Time

This repository contains code for experiments for the following paper :

[Preference-Learning with Response Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22820)


Consists of the following directories:
- `linea-bandits-response-time-expt/` recreates the linear model experiments. Use its readme for dataset generation, training linear models and plotting commands.
- `synthetic_nn/` recreates synthetic neural network experiments. Use its README for dataset generation, benchmarking scripts, and plotting commands.
- `image_experiments/` contains the PickScore-based image experiments, including data preparation, embedding extraction, training code.
- `linear-bandits-response-time-expt/` recreates the experiments of best arm identification in linear bandits as described in Appendix D.2. 
Each directory ships with its own `README.md` covering environment setup and step-by-step instructions.
