# Preference-Learning-with-Response-Time

This repository contains code for experiments for the following paper :

[Preference-Learning with Response Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22820)


Consists of the following directories:
- `linear-model-synthetic/` recreates the linear model experiments. Use its README for data set generation and plotting commands.
- `synthetic_nn/` recreates synthetic neural network experiments. Use its README for dataset generation, benchmarking scripts, and plotting commands.
- `image_experiments/` contains the PickScore-based image experiments, including data preparation, embedding extraction, training code.
- `linear-bandit-expts/` recreates the linear bandit experiment where the goal is to identify the best arm. Use its README for data set generation and generating the final tables.

Each directory ships with its own `README.md` covering environment setup and step-by-step instructions.
